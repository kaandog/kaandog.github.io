SafeBike was recently featured on [NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/07/24/537746346/bikes-may-have-to-talk-to-self-driving-cars-for-safetys-sake).

As an undergraduate research assistant under Anthony Rowe, I worked on implementing a sensor network of AVR MCU's with a TDMA based protocol over 802.15.4. This sensor network was fit on a bike to get IMU, cadence, differential GPS and ToF ranging data. Asides from implementing the firmware that ran on all nodes, I also worked on designing a PCB that was used as a header to fit a UWB transceiver used in ToF ranging.
