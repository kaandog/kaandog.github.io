Touch implemented a network of rechargeable wireless low power actuator nodes that mimicked basic finger gestures to allow remote access of any appliance through an app. This was a project I worked on with Ilter Canberk, Xavier Contreras and Raghav Gupta.

The wireless nodes included a custom PCB to integrate an Atmega128rfa1, nMOSFET circuit for the servo, LiPoly battery charging circuit, a power slider switch and USB-mini header to enable charging.

The nodes operated on a custom low power RF protocol based on 802.15.4. The protocol supported an optional low power mode where nodes would periodically go into deepsleep to potentially increase the battery life upto a week, depending on usage.
