Touch implemented a network of rechargeable wireless low power actuator nodes that mimicked basic finger gestures to allow remote access of any appliance through an app. This was a project I worked on with Ilter Canberk, Xavier Contreras and Raghav Gupta.

The wireless nodes included a custom PCB to integrate an Atmega128rfa1, nMOSFET circuit for the servo, LiPoly battery charging circuit, a power slider switch and USB-mini header to enable charging.

The nodes operated on a custom RF low power protocol based on 802.15.4, coupled with a lower power mode where node's would go into deepsleep, the nodes were able to stay powered for at least a week.
